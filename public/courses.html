    <h1>Does coursework matter? Yes!</h1>
    <p><i>It shows that you have the discipline to dedicate yourself to learning about a topic without needing outside
    encouragement and motivation. The ability to self-manage is highly valuable to many different industries and job roles,
    so showing that you mastered a new skill on your own can be especially impressive.</i> ~ The Indeed Editorial Team</p>
